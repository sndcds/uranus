# Uranus

**Digitally Mapping and Sharing the Event Landscape**

> ðŸš§ Disclaimer: This repository and the associated database are currently in **beta**. Some parts of the code and data may still contain errors. Please [open an issue](#) or contact us via email if you encounter any problems.

## Introduction

**Uranus** aims to create a detailed and flexible representation of the event landscape, making it easier to create, maintain, publish, and share high-quality event data.

The database models:
- **Venues**: Physical locations of events
- **Spaces**: Descriptions of rooms or sub-locations within venues
- **Organizations**: Represented hierarchically (e.g., Institution â†’ Association â†’ Working Group)
- **Events**: Including flexible, multi-date scheduling via `EventDate`

The data is accessible through an **open API** for use in:
- Plugins (e.g., WordPress)
- Website integrations
- Custom applications

Unlike other systems that focus solely on single events, Uranus emphasizes the **relationships** between locations, dates, and organizers â€” enabling advanced search and visualizations (e.g., maps and portals).

## Target Audiences

- **Event Organizers**: Associations, initiatives, educational and cultural institutions, etc.
- **Event Enthusiasts**: Users searching for events based on:
	- Date
	- Audience
	- Type/genre
	- Location
	- Organizers
	- Accessibility
- **Portals & Institutions**: Municipalities, cultural associations, or media platforms that want to integrate event data
- **Journalists & Culture Reporters**: Looking for structured event information

## Project Status

This project was initiated by **OK Lab Flensburg** on **March 2, 2025**.

We are currently building the **first MVP** (Minimal Viable Product) to demonstrate the core concept of Uranus. The MVP will include:
- Event creation & management
- API access

More features will be added in the coming months.
